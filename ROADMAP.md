# IMS — Inventory Management System
Author: Sinan Demir
Last Updated: 2026-07-20

This roadmap organizes the development of IMS into **epochs**.
Each epoch unlocks the next capability. The system evolves from a simple
backend into a full data platform with ML and a dashboard.

Core principles:
- Events are the **source of truth**
- Schemas are **contracts**
- Pipelines must be **reproducible**
- ML depends on **data quality**

------------------------------------------------------------
EPOCH 0 — Foundations
------------------------------------------------------------

Goal: Create a minimal, reproducible backend environment.

[x] Project structure
[x] FastAPI backend
[x] PostgreSQL database
[x] Docker environment (with Fedora :Z volume fix)
[x] SQLAlchemy models
[x] Event-driven inventory schema
[x] Inventory projection (inventory_state)
[x] Alembic migrations setup

Milestone: Complete
- Database schema versioned with Alembic
- Tables: products, inventory_events, inventory_state, alembic_version
- Docker startup runs migrations automatically before serving

------------------------------------------------------------
EPOCH 1 — Event-Driven Backend

[x] Enforce product_id NOT NULL in inventory_events
[x] Add idempotency key (event_id) to inventory events
[x] Quantity normalization per event type
[x] Oversell protection (inventory cannot go below 0)
[x] SELECT FOR UPDATE concurrency safety on inventory_state row
[x] Inventory read from projection, not SUM(events)
[x] Event writes and projection updates in single transaction
[x] Duplicate SKU returns 409 Conflict
[x] Pydantic v2 migration (ConfigDict, no deprecation warnings)
[x] Structured JSON logging (app/core/logging.py)
[x] Event replay service (rebuild_inventory_state from events)
[x] Integration tests (pytest with SQLite StaticPool in-memory DB)
[x] Test isolation (tables created/dropped per function fixture)
[x] Shared test utility (tests/utils.py)
[x] Makefile targets (up, down, reset, logs, test, test-e2e, migrate, shell)
[x] E2E bash test script (test_scripts/test_sc.sh)
[x] Response models and correct status codes (201 for POST)
[x] Deterministic event ordering (ORDER BY created_at ASC, id ASC)
[x] Pagination on event listing endpoint (limit, offset)
[x] Edge case tests (return/damage sequence, large adjustments)
[x] README accurate and synced with actual endpoints

Milestone: Complete

------------------------------------------------------------
EPOCH 2 — Batch Data Platform
------------------------------------------------------------

Goal: Export the event log into a partitioned data lake.

[x] Cached data loaders (@st.cache_data with TTL)
[x] Loading spinners and empty state handling
[x] Makefile target: make dashboard

Milestone: Complete

------------------------------------------------------------
EPOCH 7 — Production Hardening & AWS Deployment (Next)
------------------------------------------------------------

Goal: Make the system production-grade and deploy it to AWS.  

Phase 1 — Quick wins (no architecture changes)  
[x] Pin all dependency versions in requirements.txt  
[x] Add /health endpoint to FastAPI app (required by AWS ALB/ECS)  
[x] Add CORS middleware to FastAPI app (origins via CORS_ORIGINS env var)  
[x] Add .env.example documenting all required environment variables  
[x] Fix docker-compose: add Postgres healthcheck, remove fragile sleep 3  
[x] Tune SQLAlchemy connection pool for cloud (pool_pre_ping, pool_size, max_overflow)  

Phase 2 — Security hardening  
[x] Add API authentication (API key header) — app/core/auth.py, X-API-Key,
      wired via Depends on every router; no-op (with a loud startup warning)
      if API_KEY is unset, by design for local dev — see SECURITY.md  
[x] Add non-root USER to Dockerfile — appuser (uid 1000, matches the default
      first-user uid on most Linux distros so the dev bind-mount stays
      writable); curl also added, since HEALTHCHECK depended on it but it
      wasn't present in the slim base image  
[x] Stop leaking internal error details (replace str(e) in forecast.py 500
      responses) — generic exceptions now return a fixed "Internal server
      error" message; only FileNotFoundError still surfaces detail (404, not
      sensitive)  
[x] Remove hardcoded credentials from docker-compose.yml and database.py
      defaults — resolved via docker-compose.prod.yml, which fails loudly on
      a missing POSTGRES_PASSWORD for real deployments. The base
      docker-compose.yml / database.py fallback (postgres/postgres) is kept
      intentionally as a local-dev-only default, same pattern as API_KEY —
      not used by either deployment path (self-hosted prod overlay or AWS)  

Phase 3 — App hardening  
[x] Raise domain exceptions in service layer instead of HTTPException —
      app/core/exceptions.py (DomainError base + ProductNotFoundError,
      DuplicateSKUError, InvalidEventError, InsufficientInventoryError), a
      single @app.exception_handler(DomainError) in main.py converts them to
      HTTP responses. app/services/ now has zero FastAPI imports  
[x] Run Uvicorn with multiple workers in production (Gunicorn +
      UvicornWorker) — docker-compose.prod.yml and infra/ecs.tf both run
      `gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`; worker count is
      WEB_CONCURRENCY (default 4) for self-hosted and the gunicorn_workers
      Terraform variable (default 2, conservative given the cheapest Fargate
      tier's 512MB) for AWS. The base docker-compose.yml dev command stays
      single-worker plain Uvicorn for easier debugging  
[x] Improve Dockerfile: multi-stage build, proper .dockerignore (non-root
      user already done, see Phase 2) — builder stage installs deps into
      /opt/venv, final stage only copies that + app code, no pip cache/apt
      lists/build layer. .dockerignore was missing .venv/ and .git/, which
      were silently adding ~1GB of dead weight to every build (COPY . .
      copied them wholesale) — final image dropped from 4.44GB to 3.22GB  

Phase 4 — Testing  
[x] Run integration tests against a real Postgres instead of SQLite —
      ci.yml's test job runs the full suite (incl. @pytest.mark.postgres
      tests like SELECT FOR UPDATE oversell protection) against a real
      Postgres service container  
[x] Add CI/CD via GitHub Actions — ci.yml runs lint/test/docker-build on
      every push and PR to main  

Phase 5 — Deployment (self-hosted + AWS)  
Two paths, not one — being open-source, the default should be the cheapest
and most portable option, with AWS available for teams that already run
there. See README.md's "Deployment" section.

Self-hosted (default, docs/deployment/self-hosted.md):  
[x] docker-compose.prod.yml — prod hardening overlay (no dev bind-mount,
      no exposed DB port, fail-loud on missing secrets)  
[x] docker-compose.caddy.yml — optional automatic HTTPS via Caddy  
[x] Self-hosted deployment guide  
[ ] Move data lake from local filesystem to object storage (S3-compatible —
      evaluate MinIO or a provider's S3-compatible bucket, not AWS-only) (#22)  
[x] Deploy dashboard alongside the API in the self-hosted stack — `dashboard`
      compose service; no app-level auth of its own, so its port stays
      unpublished until the Caddy overlay fronts it with basic_auth on a
      dedicated port (#32)  

AWS (enterprise, infra/README.md):  
[~] Configure AWS infrastructure (ECS Fargate, RDS PostgreSQL, ALB) — Terraform written (infra/), not yet applied  
[~] Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager, inject as environment variables — wired in Terraform, not yet applied  
[~] Wire CloudWatch Logs — wired in Terraform, not yet applied  
[ ] Move data lake from local filesystem to S3 (#22)  
[ ] Deploy dashboard (Streamlit on ECS, read feature store from S3)  
[ ] Set up domain + HTTPS via ACM + ALB  
[ ] Harden RDS Terraform defaults — backups, deletion_protection, multi-AZ (#20)  

Milestone: App deployable via either path with real auth, secrets management, and CI/CD  

------------------------------------------------------------
EPOCH 7 — Phase 6 — Observability, Auth Upgrade & Ops Maturity (TODO)
------------------------------------------------------------

Goal: Close out the remaining production-hardening backlog. Originally filed
as issues #16–23 under the `production-hardening` milestone; GitHub has
since reorganized this backlog (plus a second full audit pass, #27–33) into
three milestones by risk/effort — Hardening Phase A (Quick Wins), Phase B
(Moderate Risk), Phase C (Needs Scoping). Order below follows each issue's
`status:*` label (ready before blocked) and real dependencies, not filing
order — see the issue tracker for current status, this list is a
point-in-time snapshot.

[x] Add Prometheus metrics and structured JSON logging (#19) — `/metrics`
      endpoint (app/core/metrics.py) with request counters + latency
      histogram, multiprocess-safe for Gunicorn's multi-worker production
      mode (gunicorn.conf.py); RequestLoggingMiddleware logs a
      `request_completed` JSON event per request with a correlation ID,
      also returned as `X-Request-ID`. See docs/observability.md  
[x] Add model registry (MLflow) and log Prophet artifacts (#16 — help-wanted) —
      mlflow-skinny (requirements-train.txt, not part of the API image),
      SQLite-backed registry (mlflow.db + mlruns/, both gitignored). `make
      train` registers each product's model (prophet_{product_id}) and logs
      params + in-sample MAE/MAPE; serving (forecast()/load_model()) is
      unchanged — still reads models/*.pkl directly. Promotion/rollback via
      MLflow's alias API documented in docs/model-registry.md  

Hardening Phase A — Quick Wins:  
[x] Bound the `days` query param on GET /api/forecast/{product_id} (#30)  
[x] Add security response headers middleware (#27) — X-Content-Type-Options,
      X-Frame-Options, and Referrer-Policy set on every response;
      Strict-Transport-Security only when X-Forwarded-Proto is https, since
      uvicorn itself always sees plain HTTP behind Caddy/ALB
      (app/core/security_headers.py)  
[ ] Add rate limiting to /api routes (#28)  
[ ] Add security-focused lint rules to CI — ruff `S` ruleset (#29)  
[ ] Misc hardening cleanup — .dockerignore gaps, pin base image, add a
      replay-endpoint auth test (#31)  
[ ] CI: run dbt and integration tests against Postgres in CI (#18)  
[ ] Add dependency & secret scanning to CI — Dependabot, trivy/pip-audit (#17)  

Hardening Phase B — Moderate Risk:  
[x] Make migrations a one-off job, remove inline alembic from startup (#21 —
      inline migrations racing across multiple Gunicorn workers, introduced
      by the Phase 3 multi-worker change, was a real correctness risk) —
      done for both self-hosted (#38) and AWS (#39)  
[x] Add authentication in front of the Streamlit dashboard (#32) — see the
      Phase 5 self-hosted checklist above  
[x] Validate DuckDB glob paths in warehouse_service.py instead of raw
      f-string interpolation (#33) — `_safe_path()` now requires the
      resolved path to actually stay within its expected root, not just
      reject shell metacharacters; also catches symlink escapes  
[ ] Harden RDS Terraform defaults — backups, deletion_protection, multi-AZ (#20)  

Hardening Phase C — Needs Scoping:  
[ ] Replace shared API key auth with JWT/OIDC-based authentication (#23 —
      needs-review; scope before starting)  
[ ] Move data lake to S3, update export/dbt to use S3 (#22 — status:blocked,
      same item as the Phase 5 data-lake checkboxes above; unblock the
      self-hosted-vs-AWS object storage decision first)  

Milestone: Hardening Phase A / Phase B / Phase C (GitHub milestones) — see
the issue tracker for live status  

------------------------------------------------------------
EPOCH 7.1 — Dashboard UX Overhaul
------------------------------------------------------------

Goal: Epoch 6 shipped a complete, working single-page dashboard — this
epoch is the first UX-iteration pass on top of it, not a partial build.
Tracked under the GitHub milestone "UX Improvements — Dashboard".

[x] Extract cached data-loading layer into dashboard/data.py, add
      dashboard/__init__.py — behavior-preserving, no UX change yet.
      AppTest-based dashboard tests introduced (tests/test_dashboard.py,
      dashboard_db fixture in tests/conftest.py) to prove the testing
      mechanism before multipage complexity is added.
[ ] Add list_products() (app/services/product_service.py) and
      get_fleet_status() (new app/services/fleet_service.py) — backend only,
      no dashboard changes yet
[ ] Multi-page navigation via st.navigation()/st.Page() (dashboard/views/),
      product selector sourced from the products table instead of the
      feature-store parquet file (fixes numeric-ID-only display and
      products-with-no-sales-history being invisible)
[ ] Product Detail page enhancements — forecast horizon slider (1-90,
      matching the API bound), safety_stock/days_of_stock_remaining KPI
      tiles, event-type filter + pagination
[ ] Fleet Overview page — portfolio-wide KPIs, urgency filtering, row-click
      deep link into Product Detail
[ ] Admin/Ops page (replay + export controls) — was deferred until #32
      (dashboard auth) landed; now unblocked, so it ships already protected
      instead of exposed
[ ] Optional: .streamlit/config.toml theming polish

------------------------------------------------------------
EPOCH 7.2 — Real Sales-Data Ingestion
------------------------------------------------------------

Goal: today, data only enters via POST /api/inventory/events one row at a
time, or a demo-only seed script. This epoch adds a generic,
platform-agnostic ingestion path — not tied to a specific POS vendor — that
a future Shopify/Square/etc. adapter could eventually sit behind. Tracked
under the GitHub milestone "Data Ingestion — Sales Integration".

[x] Shared ingestion core (app/services/ingestion_service.py) — resolves
      each row's product by SKU (new: product_service.get_product_by_sku,
      ProductSkuNotFoundError), calls the existing record_event() per row
      (already idempotent/race-safe), collects per-row results instead of
      failing the whole batch on one bad row
[x] Generic CSV bulk-import endpoint — POST /api/inventory/events/bulk,
      columns: sku, event_type, quantity, event_id
[x] Generic HMAC-signed webhook receiver — POST /api/webhooks/ingest,
      reuses the same ingestion core, WEBHOOK_SECRET-based signature
      verification mirroring app/core/auth.py's existing hmac.compare_digest
      pattern

------------------------------------------------------------
EPOCH 8 — Kafka Streaming (Optional)
------------------------------------------------------------

Goal: Process inventory events in real time via Kafka.

[ ] Kafka + Zookeeper via Docker Compose  
[ ] Event producer (FastAPI publishes to Kafka after DB write)  
[ ] Projection updater consumer  
[ ] Data lake writer consumer  
[ ] Deduplication on consumer side  
[ ] Replay via compacted topic  

------------------------------------------------------------
EPOCH 9 — Advanced ML (Optional)
------------------------------------------------------------

Goal: Productionize the ML layer.  

[ ] Automated retraining pipeline  
[ ] Model versioning  
[ ] Feature importance analysis  
[ ] A/B testing framework for models  

------------------------------------------------------------
Full Pipeline (Current)
------------------------------------------------------------

make up          → start Docker stack  
make migrate     → apply Alembic migrations  
make test        → run pytest suite  
make test-e2e    → run bash E2E tests  
make export      → export events to data lake  
make dbt-run     → build warehouse models  
make features    → build feature store  
make train       → train Prophet models  
make dashboard   → start Streamlit dashboard at localhost:8501
