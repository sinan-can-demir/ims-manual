# IMS — Inventory Management System

[![CI](https://github.com/sinan-can-demir/ims-manual/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sinan-can-demir/ims-manual/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

An event-driven inventory platform with a full analytics pipeline and ML-powered demand forecasting. Built from scratch as a learning project covering data engineering, backend systems, and machine learning.

**Stack:** FastAPI · PostgreSQL · dbt · DuckDB · Prophet · Streamlit · Docker

> **Project status:** actively developed learning project, not a hardened production system.
> Auth is a single shared API key (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for what that does and doesn't protect against). Deployment beyond local Docker is in progress ([Epoch 7](ROADMAP.md)) — see [Deployment](#deployment) below.

---

## What it does

- Tracks inventory changes as an **immutable event log** (event sourcing + CQRS)
- Exports events to a **Parquet data lake**, transforms them in a **DuckDB warehouse** via dbt
- Trains a **Prophet forecasting model** per product on historical demand
- Serves a **Streamlit dashboard** with live inventory levels, event history, and 30-day demand forecasts

<!--
TODO: add a screenshot/GIF of the dashboard here once available.
  1. make dashboard
  2. screenshot the running app

### Core concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| `InventoryEvent` | Immutable ledger entry for every stock change |
| `InventoryState` | Pre-computed projection — reads are O(1), no aggregation at query time |
| `event_id` | Client-provided UUID for idempotent writes |
| dbt models | Dimensional warehouse (products, dates, daily snapshots) built on DuckDB |
| Feature store | Lag features + rolling averages prepared for ML training |
| Prophet model | Per-product demand forecasting with 30-day horizon |

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| API | FastAPI + Uvicorn |
| Database | PostgreSQL 15 + SQLAlchemy + Alembic |
| Validation | Pydantic |
| Data lake | Parquet files |
| Warehouse | DuckDB + dbt |
| ML | Prophet (Meta) |
| Dashboard | Streamlit |
| Containerization | Docker + Docker Compose |
| Testing | Pytest + httpx |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Quickstart (Docker)

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL + API
make up

# Run migrations
make migrate

# Seed some data, then run the full pipeline
make export       # PostgreSQL → Parquet
make warehouse    # build DuckDB warehouse tables
make dbt-run      # run dbt transformations
make dbt-test     # run data quality tests
make features     # build feature store
make train-deps   # one-off: install mlflow-skinny for the model registry
make train        # train Prophet models, logged to the MLflow registry

# Launch dashboard
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

### Local Development (no Docker)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/ims"
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

API docs available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Deployment

Two paths, depending on what you're running this for:

- **[Self-hosted](docs/deployment/self-hosted.md)** (recommended default) —
  any VPS, ~$5-20/month, no cloud account, fully open-source tooling
  (Docker Compose + optional [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) for automatic
  HTTPS). Lowest barrier to actually running this for real use.
- **[AWS](infra/README.md)** (enterprise) — Terraform for ECS Fargate + RDS +
  ALB with least-privilege IAM and OIDC-based CI/CD, for teams already
  running on AWS. More capable (managed failover, autoscaling headroom) and
  more expensive (~$75-85/month) than the self-hosted path.

Both deploy the same Docker image; neither is required to run the project
locally (see Getting Started above).

---

## API Reference

All routes below live under `/api` and require an `X-API-Key` header if
`API_KEY` is set (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) and
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)). `/health` is always unauthenticated.

### Products

```http
POST /api/products
{ "name": "Widget A", "sku": "WGT-001" }
```

### Inventory Events

```http
POST /api/inventory/events
{
    "product_id": 1,
    "event_type": "PURCHASE",
    "quantity": 100,
    "event_id": "evt-uuid-123"
}
```

| Event Type | Effect | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PURCHASE` | +quantity | Stock received |
| `SALE` | -quantity | Oversell protected |
| `DAMAGE` | -quantity | Oversell protected |
| `RETURN` | +quantity | Customer return |
| `ADJUSTMENT` | ±quantity | Manual correction |

```http
GET /api/inventory/{product_id}       # current stock level
GET /api/inventory/events/{product_id} # full event history
```

---

## Testing

```bash
make test          # unit + integration tests
make test-e2e      # end-to-end (requires Docker)
make test-all      # everything

pytest --cov=app tests/  # with coverage
```

| Test file | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `test_products.py` | Product creation, SKU uniqueness |
| `test_inventory.py` | Core inventory flow, oversell protection (Postgres-only) |
| `test_inventory_validation.py` | Input validation per event type |
| `test_idempotency.py` | Duplicate event handling |
| `test_auth.py` | API-key auth: exempt `/health`, missing/wrong/correct key, auth-disabled mode |
| `test_forecast.py` | Forecast/restock endpoints, including 404s on nonexistent products |

---

```bash
make up           # start services
make down         # stop services
make reset        # full reset (destroys data)
make migrate      # apply Alembic migrations
make logs         # tail API logs
make shell        # shell into API container
make export       # export events → Parquet data lake
make warehouse    # build DuckDB warehouse
make dbt-run      # run dbt models
make dbt-test     # run dbt data quality tests
make features     # build feature store
make train-deps   # install mlflow-skinny (one-off, for the model registry)
make train        # train Prophet models, logged to the MLflow registry

make test-e2e     # run e2e tests
make lint         # ruff check .
make format       # ruff format .
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust as needed.
