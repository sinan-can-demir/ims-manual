# IMS — Inventory Management System

[![CI](https://github.com/sinan-can-demir/ims-manual/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sinan-can-demir/ims-manual/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

An event-driven inventory platform with a full analytics pipeline and ML-powered demand forecasting. Built from scratch as a learning project covering data engineering, backend systems, and machine learning.

**Stack:** FastAPI · PostgreSQL · dbt · DuckDB · Prophet · Streamlit · Docker

> **Project status:** actively developed learning project, not a hardened production system.
> Auth is a single shared API key (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for what that does and doesn't protect against). Deployment beyond local Docker is in progress ([Epoch 7](ROADMAP.md)) — see [Deployment](#deployment) below.

---

## What Works Now

- [x] Event-sourced inventory core — append-only `InventoryEvent` log +
      `InventoryState` projection, idempotent writes (`event_id`), oversell
      protection
- [x] Product + inventory REST API (FastAPI/Postgres), API-key auth
- [x] Bulk CSV import (`POST /api/inventory/events/bulk`) — per-row partial
      success
- [x] Generic HMAC-signed webhook ingestion (`POST /api/webhooks/ingest`)
- [x] Full analytics pipeline: Parquet data lake → DuckDB warehouse → dbt
      models + data quality tests
- [x] Prophet demand forecasting per product, tracked in an MLflow model
      registry
- [x] Streamlit dashboard — live inventory, event history, 30-day forecasts
- [x] Prometheus metrics + structured JSON request logging
      (`/metrics`, `X-Request-ID`)
- [x] CI on every push/PR — lint, full test suite (incl. Postgres-only
      tests), Docker build
- [x] Self-hosted deployment path (Docker Compose + optional Caddy HTTPS)
- [x] Dashboard deployed alongside the API in the self-hosted stack, gated
      behind Caddy basic auth (the dashboard has no auth of its own)
- [x] Security response headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options,
      Referrer-Policy, conditional HSTS)

## In Progress

- [ ] Move the data lake off the local filesystem onto S3-compatible object
      storage
- [ ] Deploy the dashboard on AWS (ECS, reading the feature store from S3)
- [ ] Apply the AWS Terraform — ECS/RDS/ALB infra is written, not yet running
- [ ] Replace shared API-key auth with JWT/OIDC
- [ ] Add dependency & secret scanning to CI (Dependabot, pip-audit/trivy)

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full backlog.

## What it does

- Tracks inventory changes as an **immutable event log** (event sourcing + CQRS)
- Exports events to a **Parquet data lake**, transforms them in a **DuckDB warehouse** via dbt
- Trains a **Prophet forecasting model** per product on historical demand
- Serves a **Streamlit dashboard** with live inventory levels, event history, and 30-day demand forecasts

<!--
TODO: add a screenshot/GIF of the dashboard here once available.
  1. make dashboard
  2. screenshot the running app
  3. save under docs/images/dashboard.png
  4. replace this comment with: ![Dashboard](docs/images/dashboard.png)

### Core concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| `InventoryEvent` | Immutable ledger entry for every stock change |
| `InventoryState` | Pre-computed projection — reads are O(1), no aggregation at query time |
| `event_id` | Client-provided UUID for idempotent writes |
| dbt models | Dimensional warehouse (products, dates, daily snapshots) built on DuckDB |
| Feature store | Lag features + rolling averages prepared for ML training |
| Prophet model | Per-product demand forecasting with 30-day horizon |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Quickstart (Docker)

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL + API
make up

# Run migrations
make migrate

# Seed some data, then run the full pipeline
make export       # PostgreSQL → Parquet
make warehouse    # build DuckDB warehouse tables
make dbt-run      # run dbt transformations
make dbt-test     # run data quality tests
make features     # build feature store
make train-deps   # one-off: install mlflow-skinny for the model registry
make train        # train Prophet models, logged to the MLflow registry

# Launch dashboard
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

### Local Development (no Docker)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/ims"
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

API docs available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Deployment

Two paths, depending on what you're running this for:

- **[Self-hosted](docs/deployment/self-hosted.md)** (recommended default) —
  any VPS, ~$5-20/month, no cloud account, fully open-source tooling
  (Docker Compose + optional [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) for automatic
  HTTPS). Lowest barrier to actually running this for real use.
- **[AWS](infra/README.md)** (enterprise) — Terraform for ECS Fargate + RDS +
  ALB with least-privilege IAM and OIDC-based CI/CD, for teams already
  running on AWS. More capable (managed failover, autoscaling headroom) and
  more expensive (~$75-85/month) than the self-hosted path.

Both deploy the same Docker image; neither is required to run the project
locally (see Getting Started above).

---

## API Reference

All routes below live under `/api` and require an `X-API-Key` header if
`API_KEY` is set (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) and
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)). `/health` and `/metrics` (Prometheus format —
see [docs/observability.md](docs/observability.md)) are always
unauthenticated.

### Products

```http
POST /api/products
{ "name": "Widget A", "sku": "WGT-001" }
```

### Inventory Events

```http
POST /api/inventory/events
{
    "product_id": 1,
    "event_type": "PURCHASE",
    "quantity": 100,
    "event_id": "evt-uuid-123"
}
```

| Event Type | Effect | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PURCHASE` | +quantity | Stock received |
| `SALE` | -quantity | Oversell protected |
| `DAMAGE` | -quantity | Oversell protected |
| `RETURN` | +quantity | Customer return |
| `ADJUSTMENT` | ±quantity | Manual correction |

```http
GET /api/inventory/{product_id}       # current stock level
GET /api/inventory/events/{product_id} # full event history
```

### Bulk / Generic Ingestion

Two generic, platform-agnostic paths for real sales data — not tied to a
specific POS/e-commerce vendor — beyond posting one event at a time:

```http
POST /api/inventory/events/bulk
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: events.csv   # columns: sku, event_type, quantity, event_id
```

```http
POST /api/webhooks/ingest
X-Webhook-Signature: <hex HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body, keyed by WEBHOOK_SECRET>
{
    "source": "generic",
    "events": [
        { "sku": "WGT-001", "event_type": "SALE", "quantity": 3, "external_id": "txn_123" }
    ]
}
```

Both share one ingestion core and report per-row results — one bad row
doesn't fail the whole batch:

```json
{
    "rows_processed": 2,
    "rows_succeeded": 1,
    "rows_failed": 1,
    "results": [
        { "row_number": 1, "event_id": "...", "status": "success", "error": null },
        { "row_number": 2, "event_id": "...", "status": "failed", "error": "..." }
    ]
}
```

The webhook's `event_id` is derived as `"{source}:{external_id}"`. It's
signed separately from `/api`'s `X-API-Key` (see
[Environment Variables](#environment-variables)) — a different trust
boundary, since it's meant for an external system to call directly.

## Testing

```bash
make test          # unit + integration tests
make test-e2e      # end-to-end (requires Docker)
make test-all      # everything

pytest --cov=app tests/  # with coverage
```

| Test file | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `test_products.py` | Product creation, SKU uniqueness |
| `test_inventory.py` | Core inventory flow, oversell protection (Postgres-only) |
| `test_inventory_validation.py` | Input validation per event type |
| `test_idempotency.py` | Duplicate event handling |
| `test_auth.py` | API-key auth: exempt `/health`, missing/wrong/correct key, auth-disabled mode |
| `test_forecast.py` | Forecast/restock endpoints, including 404s on nonexistent products |
| `test_metrics.py` | `/metrics` exposition, request counters/latency, `X-Request-ID` header |
| `test_ingestion.py` | Shared ingestion core + CSV bulk import: partial success, idempotency, malformed rows |
| `test_webhook.py` | Webhook signature verification, per-source event_id namespacing, partial failure |
